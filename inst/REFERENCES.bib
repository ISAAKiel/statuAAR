However, limb length to stature proportions differ between human populations; consequently, the most accurate mathematical stature estimates will be obtained when the population being examined is as similar as possible in proportions to the population used to create the equations. The purpose of this study was to create new stature regression formulae based on direct reconstructions of stature in ancient Egyptians and assess their accuracy in comparison to other stature estimation methods. We also compare Egyptian body proportions to those of modern American Blacks and Whites. Living stature estimates were derived using a revised Fully anatomical method (Raxter et al.: Am J Phys Anthropol 130 (2006) 374–384). Long bone stature regression equations were then derived for each sex. Our results confirm that, although ancient Egyptians are closer in body proportion to modern American Blacks than they are to American Whites, proportions in Blacks and Egyptians are not identical. The newly generated Egyptian-based stature regression formulae have standard errors of estimate of 1.9–4.2 cm. All mean directional differences are less than 0.4\% compared to anatomically estimated stature, while results using previous formulae are more variable, with mean directional biases varying between 0.2\% and 1.1\%, tibial and radial estimates being the most biased. There is no evidence for significant variation in proportions among temporal or social groupings; thus, the new formulae may be broadly applicable to ancient Egyptian remains.

	abstract = {Objectives: We tested the effect of population-specific linear body proportions on stature estimation. Materials and Methods: We used a skeletal sample of 31 males and 20 females from the Early Medieval site at Pohansko (Břeclav, Central Europe) and a comparative Central European Early Medieval sample of 45 males and 28 females. We developed new population-specific equations for the Pohansko sample using anatomical reconstructions of stature, then compared percentage prediction errors (\%{PEs}) of anatomical stature from limb bone lengths using the derived Pohansko equations with those previously derived from more general European and other Early Medieval samples. Results: Among general European equations, the lowest \%{PEs} for the Pohansko sample were obtained using the equations of Formicola and Franceschi: Am J Phys Anthropol 100 (1996) 83–88 and Ruff et al.: Am J Phys Anthropol 148 (2012) 601–617. However, unexpectedly, the choice between tibial latitudinal variants proposed by Ruff et al.: Am J Phys Anthropol 148 (2012) 601–617 appeared to be sex-specific, with northern and southern variants producing lower \%{PEs} for males and females, respectively. Equations from Breitinger: Anthropol Anz 14 (1937) 249–274, Bach: Anthropol Anz 29 (1965) 12–21, and Sjøvold: Hum Evol 5 (1990) 431–447 provided poor agreement with anatomical stature. When applied to the comparative Central European Early Medieval sample, our new formulae have generally lower \%{PE} than previously derived formulae based on other European Early Medieval samples (Maijanen and Niskanen: Int J Osteoarchaeol 20 (2010) 472–480; Vercellotti et al.: Am J Phys Anthropol 140 (2009) 135–142. Conclusions: The best agreement with anatomical stature among our newly developed equations was obtained using femoral+tibial length, followed by femoral length. Upper limb bone lengths resulted in higher \%{PEs}. Variation in the tibia is likely to contribute most to potential bias in stature estimation.

There are traditional methods for constructing models that give good results for stature estimation. In this paper, we aim to investigate the usefulness of using machine learning-based models to approximate stature. Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.},

New regression equations—both least squares ({LSQ}) and reduced major axis ({RMA}) equations—were thus developed for estimating living stature from the long bone lengths of medieval inhabitants (N = 60) of Westerhus, Sweden. The living stature of these skeletal specimens was determined by using the anatomical method. Findings in this study reveal that {LSQ} regression equations systematically overestimate statures of short individuals and underestimate those of tall individuals, whereas the {RMA} equations—both combined sexes and sex-specific equation—provide more accurate stature estimations for individuals of very different statures. The combined sexes {RMA}-equations should be used for cases in which the sex is unknown because they provide more accurate stature estimations than sex-specific equation with a wrong sex determination. These new equations are more appropriate than generally used regression equations for estimating statures of the medieval period Scandinavians. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here, we develop new prediction equations based on large skeletal samples representing much of the continent and temporal periods ranging from the Mesolithic to the 20th century. Anatomical reconstruction of stature is carried out for 501 individuals, and body mass is calculated from estimated stature and biiliac breadth in 1,145 individuals. These data are used to derive stature estimation formulae based on long bone lengths and body mass estimation formulae based on femoral head breadth. Prediction accuracy is superior to that of previously available methods. No systematic geographic or temporal variation in prediction errors is apparent, except in tibial estimation of stature, where northern and southern European formulae are necessary because of the presence of relatively longer tibiae in southern samples.

The aim of this research is to investigate the reliability of these formulae for this purpose. Materials and methods Stature estimated using the Trotter and Gleser formulae was evaluated by comparing estimates with anatomically reconstructed stature in adult skeletons (N = 40) from Mediaeval England. Performance of the Trotter and Gleser equations based on femur length was compared (using standard error of the estimate ({SEE}) and mean percentage error (\%error)) with others that have been derived from archaeological and recent European ancestry populations. Performance of ordinary least squares ({OLS}) and reduced major axis ({RMA}) versions of some of the equations was also evaluated. Results 14 male and 11 female femoral equations were investigated. For females, the original ({OLS}) Trotter and Gleser “White” equations produced the lowest {SEE} and \%error. For the males, the most reliable was the {RMA} version of the Trotter and Gleser “White” {WWII} equation; the Trotter and Gleser equations based on the Korean War dead performed poorly. Discussion In an archaeological target population, stature estimation equations devised using archaeological reference populations from a similar ecogeographic zone did not perform better than those based on recent populations. There was no indication that either the {RMA} or {OLS} approach produced consistently lower {SEE} and \%error, but the former more faithfully represented the variation in anatomically reconstructed stature present in the study group.},

	abstract = {Despite discoveries of relatively complete hands from two early hominin species (Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus sediba) and partial hands from another (Australopithecus afarensis), fundamental questions remain about the evolution of human-like hand anatomy and function. These questions are driven by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology (shaped bifacial stone tools). Modern and Middle to Late Pleistocene humans share a suite of derived features in the thumb, wrist, and radial carpometacarpal joints that is noticeably absent in early hominins. Here we show that one of the most distinctive features of this suite in the Middle Pleistocene to recent human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, was present ∼1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.},

The male-to-female ratio was 1.95:1. Because of biases in the study population, the actual incidence and prevalence of significant limb-length discrepancies is likely to be considerably higher. A questionnaire administered to surgeons of the French Orthopedic Society revealed that the majority of surgical lengthenings were performed by large orthopedic teams. In the 418 procedures reported, the tibia was lengthened more often than the femur (ratio 1.1:1). Gradual distraction techniques were used in 89.4\% of cases, with the Hi' zarov apparatus used in 57.4\%, the Wagner apparatus in 20.6\%, and the Orthofix fixator in 11.2\%. Immediate distraction techniques were used in 7.9\% of cases, 85\% of which were done on the femur. Average total lengthening was 51 mm for tibia and femur. Average lengthening was greater for methods of gradual distraction (53.5 mm) than for immediate distraction (31.4 mm).},

Leg-length inequality is most often divided into two groups: anatomic and functional. Part I of this review analyses data collected on anatomic leg-length inequality relative to prevalence, magnitude, effects and clinical significance. Part {II} examines the functional "short leg" including anatomic-functional relationships, and provides an outline for clinical decision-making.

Methods
Online database – Medline, {CINAHL} and {MANTIS} – and library searches for the time frame of 1970–2005 were done using the term "leg-length inequality".

Results and Discussion
Using data on leg-length inequality obtained by accurate and reliable x-ray methods, the prevalence of anatomic inequality was found to be 90\%, the mean magnitude of anatomic inequality was 5.2 mm ({SD} 4.1). The evidence suggests that, for most people, anatomic leg-length inequality does not appear to be clinically significant until the magnitude reaches {\textasciitilde} 20 mm ({\textasciitilde}3/4").

Conclusion
Anatomic leg-length inequality is near universal, but the average magnitude is small and not likely to be clinically significant.},

Alors que l'estimation de la stature masculine est possible à l'aide des ossements de soldats dont la taille était connue de leur vivant, l'estimation de la stature féminine n'était possible que par les données cadavériques où la stature est toujours mal mesurée ; aussi nous proposons le procédé indirect suivant. Nous avons utilisé les équivalences établies entre mensurations externes des membres et les longueurs des os longs (Olivier et Pineau, 1957) ; cela nous a permis d'utiliser les données de S. de Félice (1958) sur les femmes françaises en remplaçant les segments de membres par les longueurs équivalentes des os. Nous avons ainsi calculé les valeurs les plus probables de la stature pour chaque dimension osseuse. Par rapport aux formules de Breitinger (1937) et de Trotter et Gleser (1958), nous obtenons des estimations plus faibles. Par rapport à celle de Manouvrier (1893) et à la série de Rollet que nous avons complétée, nous trouvons des valeurs plus fortes. Nous sommes satisfaits de nous trouver dans le juste milieu et nous pensons que, dorénavant, pour estimer la stature d'un squelette féminin, il vaudra mieux utiliser les formules indiquées dans le texte.},

Reconstructing living stature using the length of long bones and linear regression is the method of choice, especially in the case of poorly preserved human skeletal material obtained from archaeological excavations. Although the choice of the best formulae is usually based on intuition, the need for a more formal approach is paramount. However, the solutions adopted to date require a significant number of well-preserved skeletons, which is rarely possible in bioarchaeological research. For skeletal series consisting of very incomplete skeletons, it has been shown that a simple comparison of the mean differences in stature estimation using femur, humerus, and radius bone pairs may be instrumental for selecting the most appropriate of the available stature reconstruction methods. The results were confronted with the consistency of the same methods but also using bones that could not have been used previously; that is the tibia, fibula and ulna. All the methods tested were then compared with those selected as being the most consistent to see if the results they produce are significantly different.},

The data consist of length measurements taken on all ten metatarsals as well as on cadaver length from a sample of 130 adults of documented race, sex, stature, and, in most cases, age. Significant correlation coefficients (.58–.89) are shown between known stature and foot bone lengths. Simple and multiple regression equations computed from the length of each of these bones result in standard errors of estimated stature ranging from 40–76 mm. These errors are larger than those for stature calculated from complete long bones, but are approximately the same magnitude for stature calculated from metacarpals and fragmentary long bones. Given that metatarsals are more likely to be preserved unbroken than are long bones and given the ease with which they are accurately measured, the formulae presented here should prove useful in the study of historic and even prehistoric populations.},

	abstract = {Archaeological assemblages often lack the complete long bones needed to estimate stature and body mass. The most accurate estimates of body mass and stature are produced using femoral head diameter and femur length. Foot bones including the first metatarsal preserve relatively well in a range of archaeological contexts. In this article we present regression equations using the first metatarsal to estimate femoral head diameter, femoral length, and body mass in a diverse human sample. The skeletal sample comprised 87 individuals (Andamanese, Australasians, Africans, Native Americans, and British). Results show that all first metatarsal measurements correlate moderately to highly (r = 0.62–0.91) with femoral head diameter and length. The proximal articular dorsoplantar diameter is the best single measurement to predict both femoral dimensions. Percent standard errors of the estimate are below 5\%. Equations using two metatarsal measurements show a small increase in accuracy. Direct estimations of body mass (calculated from measured femoral head diameter using previously published equations) have an error of just over 7\%. No direct stature estimation equations were derived due to the varied linear body proportions represented in the sample. The equations were tested on a sample of 35 individuals from Christ Church Spitalfields. Percentage differences in estimated and measured femoral head diameter and length were less than 1\%. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to use the first metatarsal in the estimation of body mass and stature. The equations presented here are particularly useful for assemblages where the long bones are either missing or fragmented, and enable estimation of these fundamental population parameters in poorly preserved assemblages.

In this study we evaluate the femur/stature ratio in 51 different “populations” of contemporary humans (n = 13,149) sampled from all over the world. We find that the mean ratio of femur length to stature in these populations is 26.74\%, with a very restricted range of variation. When we compare mean femur/stature ratios of males and females, there are no statistically significant differences. {ANOVA} performed on a naive grouping of samples into “whites,” “blacks,” and “Asians” indicates that there are significant racial differences (P {\textless} 0.001). When we subject these groups to Tukey's {HSD} procedure (a post-hoc test), we find that “blacks” are responsible for the significant {ANOVA}, being significantly (P {\textless} 0.005) different from the other ethnic groups. “Whites” and “Asians” are not significantly different (P = 0.067) under the conditions of this analysis, although all these racial comparisons may be suspect given the small sample sizes. We tested the efficacy of the ratio in three situations: predicting stature of repatriated white Vietnam veterans; predicting stature in a random sample of South African blacks (of known stature), and predicting the stature of a single Akka pygmy. In the first and third cases, the femur/stature ratio does better than the traditionally recommended regression equation, while in the second case the predictions from the femur/stature ratio are less accurate than from the appropriate regression equation. These results encouraged us to apply this ratio to mid- and late-Pleistocene fossil hominids, where the choice of reference population for stature estimates continues to trouble workers. We estimated stature for a sizeable number of Homo erectus ({HE}), early Neanderthal ({EN}), Near Eastern Neanderthal ({NEN}), and early anatomically modern Homo sapiens ({EAMHS}) by using the simple relationship: stature (cm) = femur length (cm) * 100 / 26.74. Our results show that {HE} fossils are slightly taller on average than either {EN} or {NEN} samples, which do not differ significantly in stature, while {EAMHS} fossils are significantly taller than all three earlier groups. While these results are not surprising, our stature estimates for these fossils differ from currently published estimates based on sample-specific regression-based formulae. We compare the results, discuss the differences, and highlight potential sources of error in both regression and ratio-based estimates of stature. We conclude that in estimating stature of hominid fossils the femur/stature ratio, which is gender- and ethnic-group neutral and simpler to calculate, may provide more satisfactory results than the group-specific regression formulae.},

Milano: Giuffre A. 1939), in which stature estimates derived from different limb bones are compared, was employed. The equations proposed by Pearson (Philos Trans R Soc London 192 (1899) 169–244) and Trotter and Gleser for Afro-Americans (Am J Phys Anthropol 10 (1952) 463–514; Am J Phys Anthropol 47 (1977) 355–356) provided the most consistent estimates when applied to our sample. We then used the equation by Pearson for further analyses. Results indicate a reduction in stature in the transition from the Iron Age to the Roman period, and a subsequent increase in the transition from the Roman period to the Medieval period. Changes of limb lengths over time were more pronounced in the distal than in the proximal elements in both limbs. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2008. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Stature estimates provided by the application of the anatomical method of Fully and Pineau (1960) to well preserved Neolithic skeletons (39 males and 27 females) from seven different European countries are compared with those drawn from lower-extremity components by means of regression equations commonly used to predict stature of earlier European populations. The analysis of data, carried out with reference both to the sample of origin of the skeletons adn to stature classes, suggests that the equations of Pearson (1899) and of Trotter and Gleser for Negroes (1952, 1977) yield very good estimates in female samples, leading to errors below 2 cm in most of the cases. These equations, and those of Olivier et al. (1978), prove useful for stature reconstruction in males too, with the exception of very low (below 154 cm) and very tall (over 179 cm) individuals. Formulae of Breitinger (1938) yield values consistent with those resulting from the anatomical method only within a range including medium-high statures, while the coresponding Bach (1965) formulae for females provide poor approximations. The Trotter and Gleser formulae for Whites (1952) yield very unsatisfactory evaluations, except in specimens taller than 180 cm, and usually overestimate stature both in male and in female skeletons. The results obtained from the long bones by means of alternative approaches to the least-squares regression formulae (Model {II} regression, and femur/stature ratio) and their efficacy in predicting stature of the samples under study is discussed in the final part of the paper. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Stature estimation methods for adult indigenous humans from the Americas have generally relied on a limited number of regression equations. The available equations, however, are not broadly applicable to the diversity of the populations that lived in the New World prior to European colonization. Furthermore, some equations that have been used were originally derived from inappropriate reference samples, such as the “Mongoloid” group measured by Trotter and Gleser (Am J Phys Anthropol 16 [1958] 79-123). This study develops new stature estimation equations for long bones of the lower limb from a geographically diverse sample of North American archaeological sites. Statures were reconstructed from 967 skeletons from 75 archaeological sites using the revised Fully anatomical technique (Raxter et al., Am J Phys Anthropol 130 [2006] 374-384). Archaeological samples were grouped according to general body proportions, using relative tibia and femur length to stature as guides. On the basis of differences in these proportions, three broad groupings were identified: a high latitude “arctic” group, a general “temperate” group, and a Great Plains group. Sex-specific ordinary least squares regression formulae were developed based on femoral and tibial lengths for each of these groups. Comparisons of the new stature estimation equations with previously available equations were conducted using several archaeological test samples. In most cases, the new stature estimation equations are more precise than those previously available, and we recommend their use throughout most of North America. The equations developed by Genovés for Mesoamerican and {US} Southwest samples are a useful alternative for these regions. Applicability of the new equations to South American samples awaits further testing. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
