\title{Calculate stature estimation according to: Feldesman et al 1990.}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame containing informations on individual, bone and measurement.}
}
\value{
data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.
}
\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on a regression calculation of one bone,
not separated  by sex (Feldesman et al 1990).
Bone measures used: Fem1

If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
If sex is indet. the mean of male and female stature estimation is given.
Based on the measurement of the Femur (Fem1) of different individuals,
the stature for males and females is calculated.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
