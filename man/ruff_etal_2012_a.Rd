\title{Calculate stature estimation according to: Ruff el al 2012, All (indet).}
\usage{
ruff_etal_2012_a(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame of type statuaar_data_table, containing informations on individual, bone and measurement.}
}
\value{
data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.
}
\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the hierarchy of different regression calculations,
separated  by sex and region (Ruff et al 2012). The authors provide various formulas,
whereby they primarily use the sum of femur and tibia length for the regional groups
due to its greater accuracy, while the undifferentiated calculations are based on
separate measurements of the femur, humerus and radius. Depending on the measurements
provided for each individual, regional assignment may result in a missing stature
estimate. In addition, as an alternative to each separately calculated regional group,
a calculation can be performed for a mixed data set.
The authors do not refer to a hierarchical application of the respective formulas,
but the repeated emphasis on \%SEE as a quality characteristic suggests this.
In addition, averaging the results of both formulas for the respective regional group
would inadmissibly include the length of the tibia multiple times.
Bone measures used in hierarchical order of percent standard error of estimate (\%SEE):

If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
}
