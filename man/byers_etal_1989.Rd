\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on a regression calculation of one bone,
not separated  by sex (Byers et al 1989).
Bone measures used: Os metatarsale I, apex of the capitulum to the midpoint
of the articular surface of the base parallel to the longituninal axis of the bone.

If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
The  correlation coefficient does not increase with sex differentiation and thus
will be ignored. Based on the length of the Os metatarsale I of different individuals,
the stature for males and females is calculated.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
