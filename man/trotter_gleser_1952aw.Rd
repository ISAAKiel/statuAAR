\title{Calculate stature estimation according to: Trotter & Gleser 'American White'.}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame containing informations on individual, bone and measurement.}
}
\value{
data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.
}
\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the hierarchy of different regression calculations,
separated  by sex (Trotter & Gleser 1952, 1977) series 'American White'.
Bone measures used: Fem1, Tib1b, Fib1, Uln1, Rad1, Hum1
If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
If sex is indet. the mean of male and female stature estimation is given.
The calculation is based on Trotter & Gleser (1952) with corrections from
Trotter & Gleser (1977). The regression formula are hierarchical from
combinations of different bone measures to single bone measures. Only the
first applicable measure will be used.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
}
