\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the mean of several multiple and single
regression calculations, separated  by sex (Pearson 1899).
Bone measures used: Hum1, Rad1, Fem1, Tib1b, Tib1a

If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
If sex is indet. the mean of male and female stature estimation is given.
According to Pearson (1899, 196-97) following measure substitudes will be used:
male: Fem1 = Fem2 + 3.2 mm, Tib1b = Tib1a - 9.6 mm
female: Fem1 = Fem2 + 3.3 mm, Tib1b = Tib1a - 8.7 mm
Pearson's work is based on the bones from the right side. According to
measurements from Rollet (1888) he provides correction values for the bones of
the left side. These values vary for male within +/- .4 - 4.2 mm and for
female within +/- 0.4 - 5.1 mm. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is a complex
process due to multiple causes with environmental and genetic factors and
increasing with age. Based on French data minor LLD is often, but if treated
in most cases below 2 cm per leg. In addition differences between sex and
left vs right side are observed (Guichet et al 1991, Holliday & Ruff 2001,
Knutson 2005). In consequence a compounded correction between left and right
bones by the values derived from the sample of Rollet (1888) is rejected.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
