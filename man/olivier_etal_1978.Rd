\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the hierarchy of different regression calculations,
separated  by sex (Olivier et al 1978).
Bone measures used: Hum2, Hum1, Rad1b, Fem1, Tib1b

If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
If sex is indet. the mean of male and female stature estimation is given.
The regression formula are hierarchical from combinations of different
bone measures to single bone measures. For the multiple regressions the average
of left and right bone is used, allthough "asymmetry to be virtually negligible:
it is only significant for the right ulna" (Olivier et al 1978, 515).
For individual bone measures regression formula a given for left an right side
in the case of male individuals. Wheras regression formula for females are
presented only for left bones, likely due to the set of data based on.
In  consequence for male individuals stature estimation on a single bone is
calculated 1. upon the hierarchy given by the table (r, s.d.) and
2. on the mean of left an right bone or 3. on one of both sides.
Wheras for female individuals stature estimation based on one bone considers
\enumerate{
\item the hierarchy given by the table (r and s.d) using the mean of left and/or
right side.
For male 15 multiple regressions are provided, for female only 9,
in addition these use different bone measures within each hierarchy.
In consequence, stature estimation for both do not correlate and
the alternative stature will not be calculated.
Only the first applicable measure of the given hierarchy will be used.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
