\title{Calculate stature estimation according to: Sjøvold 1990.}

data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.

\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the mean of different regression calculations,
not separated  by sex (Sjøvold 1990).
Bone measures used: Hum1, Rad1 (alt. Rad1b), Uln1, Fem1 (alt. Fem2),
Tib1 (alt. Tib1b), Fib1
If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
Allthough not explained in the text estimated stature is derived from the mean
of all calculations from the bone measures. To not multiply significance in the
case of two measures per bone (e.g. Fem 1, Fem2) only one of both will be
calculated.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
}
