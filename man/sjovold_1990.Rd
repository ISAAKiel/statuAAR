\title{Calculate stature estimation according to: Sjøvold 1990.}
\usage{
sjovold_1990(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame of type statuaar_data_table, containing informations on individual, bone and measurement.}
}
\value{
data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.

\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the mean of different regression calculations,
not separated  by sex (Sjøvold 1990).
Bone measures used: Hum1, Rad1 (alt. Rad1b), Uln1, Fem1 (alt. Fem2), Fib1.
If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
The author discusses the correlation and disadvantages of the various regression
calculations. Only the calculations based on the tibia are rejected by Sjøvold,
while all other regressions appear equally valid to him. Ruff et al (2012)
recognise a known trend towards geographical latitude for the tibia.
Allthough not explained in the text estimated stature is derived from the mean
of all calculations from the bone measures excluding Tibia (s.a.). To not multiply
significance in the case of two measures per bone (e.g. Fem 1, Fem2) only one
of both will be calculated.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
}
