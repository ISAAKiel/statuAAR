\title{Calculate stature estimation according to: Raxter el al 2008.}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame containing informations on individual, bone and measurement.}
}
\value{
data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.
}
\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on the hierarchy of different regression calculations,
separated  by sex (Raxter el al 2008).
Bone measures used in hierarchical order of correlation (r):
male: Fem1+Tib1a, Fem2+Tib1a, Tib1a, Tib1b, Fem1, Fem2, Hum1+Rad1, Hum1, Rad1
female: Tib1b, Tib1a, Fem2+Tib1b, Fem1+Tib1a, Fem2, Fem1, Hum1, Hum1+Rad1, Rad1
If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
If sex is indet. the mean of male and female stature estimation is given.
The authors do not mention, if the mean of all regressions is used or the
first possible stature estimation according to hierarchical order of
correlation. As the authors discuss the correlation and refere to the
work of Trotter & Gleser a hierarchical order is supposed (s. Siegmund 2010,
p. 20). As correlation within male and females is highly different and provides
a sex specific order of regressions the stature of individuals with
indeterminated sex (indet.) is calculated by the mean of both at each rank
mentioning all bone measures used and the sum of n_measures.

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included:
e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right) + 1 Tib1}
