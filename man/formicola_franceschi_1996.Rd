\title{Calculate stature estimation based on bone measures according to: Formicola & Franceschi 1996.}

data.frame with calculated stature and related information per individual.

\description{
Stature estimation (mm) based on a hierarchical order of regression calculations,
separated  by sex and based on: Fem2+Tib1, Fem1, Tib1, Hum1, Rad1.
If bone measures for left and right are provided the mean value will be used,
but for statistic information 2 bones will be counted (n_measures).
If sex is indet. the mean of male and female stature estimation is given.
Formicola and Franceschi (1996) do not provide information on hierarchie or mean calculation
of the regression formula, but table 3 gives standard error (S.E.) and correlation
from which a hierarchical order can be derived. The order of bone measures used
according to achieved correlation differs between sex and will be respected,
allthough  differences are small. Due to this, the order used differs slightly from
Siegmund (2010, 116 (12.8)).

Bone measures used: Fem2+Tib1, Tib1, Fem1, Hum1, Rad1 (or Rad1a)

Returns a data.frame with:
\itemize{
\item{ ind: individual identifyer (rownames), }
\item{ sex: as provided for calculation: m, f, indet.}
\item{ stature: estimated on the provided sex and bone measures, }
\item{ bone (measure(s)): bones used for calculation, }
\item{ female (stature): columns with alternative stature for three sex classes, }
\item{ male (stature), }
\item{ indet. (stature) and}
\item{ n_measures: number of bone measures included: e.g. 2 Fem2 (left, right), 1 Tib1}
